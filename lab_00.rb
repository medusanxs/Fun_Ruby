Lab 00: irb

Open the irb interface and familiarize yourself with its operation:
* Do some basic arithmetic
  * Notice the difference between dividing 5 by 2, vs 2.0
  * Notice the % operator.  This is related to integer division in that it
    returns the remainder.  e.g. 5 % 2 == 1
* Create a function and call it.
* All objects have a methods method (e.g. Array#methods).  Call the methods
  method on some objects and explore their functionality.  Consult the
  documentation as needed.
* Assignment is managed via the = operator.  For example:
    a = 5
  will result in the object 5 being assigned to the variable a, until a is
  changed.  Get used to using variables to hold references to objects as you
  work with them.
